# Welcome to my porfolio

Here you'll find some scripts that hepls me to understand better somethings about interesting topics for me.

In Data Engineering scripts we'll use Docker to run a container that includes Spark and Jupiter.


### Download Docker:

#### Windows and macOS
Docker Compose is included in
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
for Windows and macOS.

#### Linux
You can download Docker Compose binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.

#### Using pip
If your platform is not supported, you can download Docker Compose using `pip`:

```console
pip install docker-compose
```
> **Note:** Docker Compose requires Python 3.6 or later.

### Using Docker Compose for this process:
1. Download docker-compose.yml file.
2. Run Docker from cmd or your console.
3. Reach the directory where the file is and run `docker-compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire
   app.
4. Open Jupiter Notebook in your web browser with the link that your cmd or conselo show you.
